Replicates Figure 3.
The file BEHAVIORALSMOOTHINGDISTRIBUTION.r replicates the figure once the weights and the particles of skills are generated (W0-W2MATRIX.csv and S0-S2MATRIX.csv files). 

In order to generate those files, I included the makefile and necessary code in C++ to generate them. With the makefile, all you have to do is run 

``make smoothdistrun‚Äù

in the command line.
